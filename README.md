<h1> University Chatbot Guide</h1>
Waiting for hours to seek guidance on university-related queries, especially during critical processes like registration and specification conversions, has been a frustrating experience for many students. This challenge highlights the necessity of an accessible and responsive solution.

<b>In response</b>, we are embarking on a project to develop an intent-based chatbot system that operates 24/7. This system will cater to the diverse concerns and issues faced by students, offering real-time assistance on a wide array of university-related matters. By creating this chatbot guide, we aim to streamline the student experience, providing instant, clear, and reliable information to ensure a smoother journey through their academic pursuits.
